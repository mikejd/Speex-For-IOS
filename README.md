# Speex-For-IOS

This project was conceived in ealy 2013 as a simple open iOS library for encoding and decoding Speex audio files, but was abandoned soon, because I had neither resources nor skill and motivation to implement it at the time, sorryâ€¦

However I decided to publish here a small demo Xcode project, which can be of some help as a rough reference about how the encoding can be done. It was initially posted about two years to illustrate my [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/15832727/1664795) on Stackoverflow, but now the link there is not working anymore.
